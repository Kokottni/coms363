# coms363
This repository contains all database based projects from coms363 with project descriptions in each file.

The projects in this repository are all in different languages.

At the beginning of the semester, we began with learning SQL and using MySQLWorkbench to create, add, modify, and delete databases.
Project 1.A uses strictly sql.
Project 1.B utilizes java to do all of our SQL functions from 1.A but has several changes to the actual functionality of the database.

I then moved on to using a newer database type known as Neo4J which is a more visual type of database free to use online, being Project2.
It has its own language that is fairly easy to pick up and I find it more versatile than SQL, however, it is more costly.
These commands can be input directly to the Neo4J website to do the things you want to do with it. As well as this you can manually create tables in the database rather than code it like in SQL.

Finally, the semester was finished with Python scripts, parsing a json file for data and writing prompts to query for certain data.
We also used the apriori algorithm to find frequently occurring sets within the json.
